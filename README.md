This is a repository where you can find all my work with the following data estructures:
- Graphs
- Trees (including BST, AVL and priority queues)
- Hash tables

All of them are working perfectly and deep-test-passing, but if you find any problem comment it please.

Also the code is documented in Spanish, but is very easy to translate it.

## ðŸ—‚ Directory organization ðŸ—‚
You will find 3 directories:
- **Mis Tareas**: it contains my original work that i made for my university homework.
- **PrÃ¡ctica**: it contains my original work but better done and beter documented, so you'd better check this one. <----- check the previous one ----->
- **TeorÃ­a**: it contains all the theory that my proyects are based on.

I will also thank you an star if you use this repository :-) 

Enjoy it.
